    end_year: 1977
    description: "The original Ford Transit revolutionized the European van market with car-like driving dynamics and styling that contrasted with forward-control designs common at the time. Introduced in October 1965 as Ford of Europe's first unified platform, it featured front engine/rear-wheel drive architecture with Essex V4 engines in the UK (1.7L and 2.0L) and Taunus V4 engines in mainland Europe (1.3L, 1.5L, and 1.7L). A diesel option from Perkins (43 hp) was offered but proved unpopular due to being underpowered; it was replaced by Ford's own York engine in 1972. The diesel version required a longer bonnet nicknamed the 'pig snout' to accommodate the engine length. Available in numerous configurations including panel van, minibus, pickup, and chassis cab, it gained a reputation for versatility and durability. A minor facelift in 1971 updated front end styling on V4 models with a safety-padded dashboard."

  - name: "First Generation (Mark II Facelift)"
    start_year: 1977
    end_year: 1986
    description: "In August 1977, a facelifted version codenamed 'Transit 1978½' but commonly called the Mark II debuted with a restyled, longer nose section that could properly accommodate inline engines. This allowed the Ford Pinto engine from the Cortina to become the Transit's dominant power unit (1.6L OHC and 2.0L OHC petrol options). The new frontal styling brought the Transit in line with Ford of Europe's passenger car range with square headlamps and black louvred grille. The austere dashboard was replaced with a full-width plastic fascia from the Taunus/Cortina Mk4. High-performance versions used the 3.0L Essex V6 for police and ambulance services. In 1984, a minor facelift added grey plastic front grille with integrated headlamp surrounds and multifunction rear lights. Four-wheel drive was offered from 1982 for the German market, developed with Sinpar."

    description: "Codenamed VE6, the second-generation Transit featured an all-new 'one-box' bodyshell design where windscreen and bonnet are at close to the same angle. Front suspension changed to fully independent configuration on SWB versions. Initial engines carried over from the Mark II, with the high-performance 3.0L Essex V6 replaced by Cologne 2.9 EFI V6 in 1989 due to emissions regulations. Assembly plants included Genk (Belgium), Southampton (UK), and Ford Otosan (Turkey). Production continued in China until 2017 and Vietnam until 2003. The platform was also built under license by Jiangling Motors in China."
